# TV-Buttons

Scheduling conflicts didn't allow me much time with this project this week, but I think I started it off pretty strong. 

I need to wrap the AJAX call in a function, probably named displayShows, so that I can call it later in the code. 

I need to finish the submit button on-click function by calling a function I have not yet written: display buttons (this function will create buttons in newButtons div with the user inputs).

I need to create an on-click function for class "tvshowBtn" to run the ajax function.

I need to create a function for pausing gifs. (if/else statement)

I need to create an on-click function for gifs to run the pause/play function.



I am looking forward to finishing this project this week.
